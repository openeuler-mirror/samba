MIT Kerberos 5 Support
=======================

Fedora is using MIT Kerberos implementation as its Kerberos infrastructure of
choice. The Samba build in Fedora is using MIT Kerberos implementation in order
to allow system-wide interoperability between both desktop and server
applications running on the same machine.

In this build the Active Directory support has been disabled.
